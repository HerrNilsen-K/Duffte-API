In Progress:
	Look over mainWindowHandler/gameWindow
	triangle class parameter coords needs to be relative to the window, not the NDC (function needs to retrive the size of the window)

New Features:
	rectangle class
	
Bugs: 
	"Window" initilizes glfw for every object

Refactoring:
	variables in classes need comments
	The key input system is really fucked up and needs a big rework
